## Intelligent Vehicle Racing Monitor and Recording System
TrackPack is a compact device designed for car enthusiasts that monitors and records vehicle performance. With an affordable way to track your vehicles performance, the driver can take their experience to the next level. The objective is to provide a user-friendly and portable device where drivers can easily log and review the performance parameters for their vehicle.

### How do we measure performance?
TrackPack utilizes an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which contains the folling sensors:
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer

In addition to collecting metrics from the IMU, TrackPack also uses an OBD2 Bluetooth dongle that allows the user to access the parameters from the vehicle onboard computer.

### How to use TrackPack?
By using the data collected from the IMU and the additional metrics from the vehicles computer, we designed a suite of useful tools intended for off-road track usage.
TracPack has three primary functions:
- OBD2 Data
- Parameter Logging
- Review Stored Data

#### OBD2 Data
The OBD2 Data mode establishes a connection with the Bluetooth OBD2 dongle and allows the user to read live data from the vehicle's onboard computer, and read Check Engine Light information.
#### Parameter Logging
The Parameter Logging mode initializes the IMU and the Bluetooth OBD2 dongle and allows the user to view their live speed and g-force while also tracking useful drag strip time parameters.
#### Review Stored Data
The Review Stored Data mode allows the using to view a freeze frame of a previous parameter log which contains their top speed and g-force, and the useful drag strip time parameters.
